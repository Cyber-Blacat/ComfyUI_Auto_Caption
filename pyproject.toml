description = "This report contains a 'load many images' node which is going to load the image set by the number of file names from smallest to largest, and the images will no longer be loaded in the wrong order! Setting index=0 makes it load from the first small value (image flie name) image, and index=2 will load them from the second image. Another node 'load images & resize' can resize the image by the first loaded image."
